# Zombie Eligibilty 
An example of a Python solution for duplicate data.

The Zombie Eligibility Problem was discovered when we migrated from a third party data pipeline to a custom internal pipeline. We had individuals still enrolled on the third-party pipeline (called HCRM) and were also enrolled in our custom Python / Ruby pipeline. We needed to disenroll the individuals on the HCRM data to reduce eligibility counts and costs. This is important as we bill clients based on population count.
