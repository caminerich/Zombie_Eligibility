# Zombie Eligibilty 
An example of a Python solution for removing duplicate data from a Relatioal Database.

The "Zombie Eligibility Problem" was discovered when we transitioned away from obtaining normalized data from a third party data vender, named HCRM, and implemented custom Python mapping or data normalization scripts.  Individuals are still enrolled in HCRM data source while also showing enrollment in our direct data source, causing inflated monthly elibility counts that went undiscovered by our data quality reporting.  We need to disenroll the individuals on the HCRM data to reduce eligibility counts and costs. This is important to maintain data integrity and build trust with our clients.
